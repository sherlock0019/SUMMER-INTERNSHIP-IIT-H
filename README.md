There are 2 types of power transfer : Alternating and Direct currents, i.e., AC & DC.
We have Rectifiers to convert from 3 phase AC to DC.
Similarly, we have Inverters to convert from DC to 3 phase AC.
Also, DC to DC conversion is employed using a Buck-Boost converter, in which we can alter the DC voltage magnitude (increase/decrease).
Furthermore, we have AC to AC conversion taken care by a Transformer, which can alter the peak-peak voltage of the AC voltage (increase/decrease), but not altering its frequency.
Our discussion is about DC to AC conversion and hence we are going to discuss about inverters.
